# Twitter Scraper with Playwright

A simple web application that uses Playwright to directly scrape Twitter profiles and save the data to both text files and Excel spreadsheets.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install the browser:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

3. That's it! No API keys or credentials needed.

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Enter a Twitter username (without @)

4. Click "Start Scraping" and watch the browser work!

## How It Works

- Navigates to the Twitter profile
- Extracts tweet data directly from the DOM elements:
  - Tweet text from `[data-testid="tweetText"]`
  - Date from `time` elements
  - Likes from `[data-testid="like"]`
  - Retweets from `[data-testid="retweet"]`
  - Tweet URLs from status links
- Scrolls to load more tweets
- Saves everything to both text and Excel files
